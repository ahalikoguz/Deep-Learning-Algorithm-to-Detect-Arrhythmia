### Pretrained Model File (`model.pt`)

This repository includes a pretrained model file named `model.pt`, which is essential for running the ECG classification script locally. This file contains the weights of a deep learning model that has been pre-trained on a comprehensive dataset for accurate ECG analysis.

#### How to Use the Pretrained Model

To utilize this model for testing or evaluation purposes, please follow these steps:

1. **Download the Model**: First, download the `model.pt` file from this repository. 

2. **Place the Model in the Correct Directory**: After downloading, place the file in an appropriate directory on your local machine.

3. **Modify the Script to Locate the Model**: In the ECG classification script, update the `model_path` variable to point to the directory where you placed the `model.pt` file. This step is crucial for the script to correctly load the model for inference.

    For example:
    ```python
    model_path = "path_to_your_directory/model.pt"
    ```

#### Model Specifications

The `model.pt` file is a PyTorch model file containing the architecture and learned parameters of our deep learning model. It is optimized for efficient ECG classification and can be used directly without the need for further training.
